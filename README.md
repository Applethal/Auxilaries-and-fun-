# Factorial (29/09/2022)

Python provides a  direct method to calculate factorials, but I decided to make a function for it. It was fun, GGs!

# Combinations (30/09/2022)

Without using the factorial function provided by Python, I have tried to write a python code that allows for that.

# Odd or even (1/10/2022)

There are lots of ways to tell if a number is Odd or even in Python. 
I liked how this exercise tested my limited algorithm building skills.

# Fibonacci (04/10/2022)

This is where I learned about reccursion by inspecting a friend's code, it was fun. 
I wish I could build my own function but I had to borrow the formula from Wikipedia and it.

I updated the codes to include user input functions. Thanks anas.
