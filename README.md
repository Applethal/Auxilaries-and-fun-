# Factorial (29/09/2022)

Python provides a  direct method to calculate factorials, but I decided to make a function for it. It was fun, GGs!

# Combinations (30/09/2022)

Without using the factorial function provided by Python, I have tried to write a python code that allows for that.

# Odd or even (1/10/2022)

There are lots of ways to tell if a number is Odd or even in Python. 
I liked how this exercise tested my limited algorithm building skills.

# Fibonacci (04/10/2022)

This is where I learned about reccursion by inspecting a friend's code, it was fun. 
I wish I could build my own function but I had to borrow the formula from Wikipedia and use it.

# 13/10/2022
I updated the codes to include user input functions. 

#Prime Numbers (06/03/2023)

New py script that checks the propriety of a number and tells if its a prime number or not. The algorithm is subject to improvements, I made it literally just by hearing one of my brothers talking about the definition of a prime number; a simple and easy improvement is to check if the number is higher than 2 and is even, if it's true then it is not a prime number for sure, else I would then check simply all the numbers starting from the square root of the number all the way down to 1. My code takes up lots of memory, but still, I am super happy with what I did, it took just 5 minutes to build and 1 minute for the bug fixes.

# Sum of all the numbers from 1 to N (08/03/2023)

Took a minute to practice recursion. Added a code to test my logic, that sums up all the non negative integers starting from 1 until a number N. I ran into some logical issues here and there but I am glad that I could manage to finish 90% of it without any external help. Originally I made the mistake to call the function twice at the end. Minutes later after writing this exact paragraph after dealing with a burning curiosity concerning whether I could achieve the same results without recursion, I spent exactly 3 minutes to reproduce the same thing without recursion and I did it. I am super happy!
