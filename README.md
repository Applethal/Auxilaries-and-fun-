# Factorial (29/09/2022)

Python provides a  direct method to calculate factorials, but I decided to make a function for it. It was fun, GGs!

# Combinations (30/09/2022)

Without using the factorial function provided by Python, I have tried to write a python code that allows for that.

# Odd or even (1/10/2022)

There are lots of ways to tell if a number is Odd or even in Python. 
I liked how this exercise tested my limited algorithm building skills.

# Fibonacci (04/10/2022)

This is where I learned about reccursion by inspecting a friend's code, it was fun. 
I wish I could build my own function but I had to borrow the formula from Wikipedia and use it.

# 13/10/2022
I updated the codes to include user input functions. 

# Prime Numbers (06/03/2023)

New py script that checks the propriety of a number and tells if its a prime number or not. The algorithm is subject to improvements, I made it literally just by hearing one of my brothers talking about the definition of a prime number; a simple and easy improvement is to check if the number is higher than 2 and is even, if it's true then it is not a prime number for sure, else I would then check simply all the numbers starting from the square root of the number all the way down to 1. My code takes up lots of memory, but still, I am super happy with what I did, it took just 5 minutes to build and 1 minute for the bug fixes.

# Sum of all the numbers from 1 to N (08/03/2023)

Took a minute to practice recursion. Added a code to test my logic, that sums up all the non negative integers starting from 1 until a number N. I ran into some logical issues here and there but I am glad that I could manage to finish 90% of it without any external help. Originally I made the mistake to call the function twice at the end. Minutes later after writing this exact paragraph after dealing with a burning curiosity concerning whether I could achieve the same results without recursion, I spent exactly 3 minutes to reproduce the same thing without recursion and I did it. I am super happy!

# Combinations (10/03/2023)

After trying so hard for more than 4 weeks to come up with an idea on how to generate all the possible permutations and insert them in a dictionary, I somehow thought about turning the elements set into 2 dimensions, and that is how I somehow found out about how to generate all the possible combinations instead of permutations. But then what if I wanted to generate the possible combinations subject to $N$ number of outcoms instead ? a recusion has to be executed, and that is my next goal for this small script.

# Mutation (21/03/2023)

New python code that allows users to swap an arbitrary element within the set with anything that they wish. This one is subject to lots of updates that I wish to include later. I plan to incorporate the famous mutation algorithms that I did learn by inspecting some combinatrics books. That was fun!

# One point crossover (27/03/2023)

Given a set of parents, provided you did not import them and that you wish to add them within a dictionary, I made a function that performs a one point crossover between 2 parents and produces 2 children containing the mixed genetics of the said parents. To do: I need to tinker a way in order to create a function that provides the possibility to create children containing more mixing, in other words: be able to implement a k-point crossover.
